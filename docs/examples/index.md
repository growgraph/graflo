# Examples 

1. [CSV with Multiple Tabular Sources](example-1.md)
2. [JSON with Self-Reference Vertices](example-2.md)
3. [CSV with Edge Weights and Multiple Relations](example-3.md)
4. [Neo4j Ingestion with Dynamic Relations from Keys](example-4.md)
5. **[🚀 PostgreSQL Schema Inference and Ingestion](example-5.md)** - **Automatically infer graph schemas from normalized PostgreSQL databases (3NF)** with proper primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK). Uses intelligent heuristics to detect vertices and edges - no manual schema definition needed! Perfect for migrating relational data to graph databases.
6. **[🔗 RDF / Turtle Ingestion with Explicit Resource Mapping](example-6.md)** - **Infer graph schemas from OWL ontologies and ingest RDF data** using explicit `SparqlPattern` resource mapping. Supports local Turtle files and remote SPARQL endpoints. Perfect for knowledge graph pipelines built on semantic web standards.
7. [Multi-Edge Weights with Filters and `dress` Transform](example-7.md)
