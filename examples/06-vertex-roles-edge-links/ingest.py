"""How do I ingest a row that mentions the same kind of thing in several roles?

Reads ``manifest.yaml``, creates the schema in ArangoDB and loads
``data/family.csv``, where each row names a person, one of their parents and
one of their children. Run it from this directory:

    uv run python ingest.py
